Project Name: DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

Problem Statement: 
  As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the companyâ€™s data. Your goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.
Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided you with several datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The company seeks to leverage this data to better understand their business and identify areas for improvement.

Domain : Retail Analytics in the Electronics Industry

About The Project: 
   This project involves data cleaning and preprocessing of the raw data, to produce processed data which removes the nonvulnerablities in the data. Then the data is merged using the common column in the data, by using the primary keys and merge() function in pandas the tables are merged. Next the combined table is transfered to the mysql database using mysql connector, so that the data can be used in visualization.
   After the preprocessing and transfering the tables to mysql. Power Bi is used to create the visualization of the insigts. Finally sql queries are implemented to show the top 10 insights from the table.

Technologies Used: 
  Pandas  -  for cleaning the table
  Mysql  -  to manage and store the table in a dataset
  Power Bi  -  to visualize the datas and produce insights

About the Files Used: 
  1. Dataspark_file1 - this file contains the code used in cleaning the dataframe
  2. Dataspark_Project2 - this ppt file contains all the created visualization and 10 insights

Conclusion: 
  By analyzing Global Electronics' customer, product, sales, and store data, we aim to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and improve sales forecasting. This will help tailor marketing campaigns, develop better products, plan effective promotions, and decide on store expansions and optimizations. Additionally, understanding the impact of currency exchange rates on sales will allow for better international pricing strategies. Overall, these insights will help Global Electronics increase customer satisfaction and drive business growth.
